### Automated Machine Learning Modelling

This project aims to provide a structure for delivering automated machine learning models and pipelines. The code will be modular and therefore easier to change for future production deployments. Some of the features include:

* Modular code based upon single responsibiliy principle
* Automated machine learning for model discovery
* Automated pipelines for repeatability
* Storing the final model in binary format using pickle
